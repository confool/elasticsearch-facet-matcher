ElasticSearch Facet Matcher
===========================

Native script for matching facet values against specified query.

It's maily supposed to be used as a validation tool for facet values when suggesting facet on array field, since you might get values that match your query along with other values in that array field.
It's pretty simple right now, it checks if facet term contains the query. We plan to include more advanced options with usage of Lucene query.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository in ElasticSearch root

```
cd /usr/share/elasticsearch
git clone https://github.com/otvorenesudy/elasticsearch-facet-matcher.git
cd elasticsearch-facet-matcher
```

2. Open `Rakefile` and change required libraries verions of `elasticsearch`, `lucene-core` and `lucene-analyzer-common` according to the ones located in your ElasticSearch `lib` directory.
3. Run `rake build`
4. Build copies `elasticsearch-facet-matcher.jar` to your ElasticSearch `lib` directory for autoloading.
5. Open `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` or `config/elasticsearch.yml` and add this to the end of the file:

```
script.native:
  facet_matcher.type: sk.opencourts.elasticsearch.FacetMatcherFactory
```

Note: You can change name of the `facet_matcher` to any name you desire.

Restart ElasticSearch and try it out.

## Example

This searches for any value in faceted field `judges.untouched` matching pattern 'peter*' by Lucene query and validates each facet value by the same query in the script.

```json
{
  "facets": {
    "judges": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "judges.untouched",
        "size": 10,
        "all_terms": false,
        "script": "facet_matcher",
        "params": {
          "query": "peter"
        },
        "lang": "native"
      },
      "global_facets": false,
      "facet_filter": {
        "query": {
          "filtered": {
            "query": {
              "bool": {
                "must": [
                  {
                    "query_string": {
                      "query": "peter* ",
                      "default_operator": "and",
                      "analyze_wildcard": true,
                      "fields": [
                        "judges.analyzed"
                      ]
                    }
                  }
                ]
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
