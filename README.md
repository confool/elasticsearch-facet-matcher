Elasticsearch Facet Matcher
===========================

Native script for matching facet values against specified query.

It's maily supposed to be used as a validation tool for facet values when suggesting facet on array field, since you might get values that match your query along with other values in array field.
It's pretty dump right now, it check if facet term contains the query. We plan to include more advanced options with usage of Lucene query.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository in elasticsearch root

```
cd elasticsearch-0.90.2
git clone https://github.com/otvorenesudy/elasticsearch-facet-matcher.git
cd elasticsearch-facet-matcher
```

2. Open `Rakefile` and change required libraries verions of `elasticsearch`, `lucene-core` and `lucene-analyzer-common` according to one locates in your elasticsearch `lib` directory.
3. Run `rake build`
4. Build copies `elasticsearch-facet-matcher.jar` to your elasticsearch `lib` dir for autoloading.
5. Open `config/elasticsearch.yml` and add this to the end of file:

```
script.native:
  facet_matcher.type: sk.opencourts.elasticsearch.FacetMatcherFactory

```

You can change name of `facet_matcher` to any name you desire.

6. Restart elasticsearch and try it out.


## Example

This searches for any value in faceted field `judges.untouched` matching pattern 'peter*' by lucene query and validates each facet value by the same query in script.

```json


{
  "facets": {
    "judges": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "judges.untouched",
        "size": 10,
        "all_terms": false,
        "script": "facet_matcher",
        "params": {
          "query": "peter"
        },
        "lang": "native"
      },
      "global_facets": false,

                      "default_operator": "and",
                      "analyze_wildcard": true,
                      "fields": [
